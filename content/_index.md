# Documentation for Adaptive LibPFASST

This page provides the documentation of Jan Fecht's [interdisciplinary project](https://www.cit.tum.de/en/cit/studies/degree-programs/master-informatics/interdisciplinary-project/) at the Technical University of Munich 2022-2023.

The goal of the project was to add dynamic MPI support to *LibPFASST*, a Fortran application that implements the PFASST method.
TODO

Multiple software components were developed or modified in the course of this project. The following software components are part of the project:

 - [Open MPI](@/open-mpi/_index.md): Patrick Huber's adaptive Open MPI fork was extended with a Fortran interface.
 - [libmpidynres](@/libmpidynres/_index.md): A Fortran interface was added to libmpidynres.
 - [LibPFASST](@/libpfasst/_index.md): The main component of this project
 - [Showcase](@/showcase/_index.md): An example application running on adaptive LibPFASST
