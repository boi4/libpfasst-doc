# Documentation for Adaptive LibPFASST

<p>This page provides the documentation of Jan Fecht's <a href="https://www.cit.tum.de/en/cit/studies/degree-programs/master-informatics/interdisciplinary-project/">interdisciplinary project</a> at the Technical University of Munich 2022-2023.</p>

The goal of the project was to add dynamic MPI support to *LibPFASST*, a Fortran application that implements the PFASST method.
TODO

<p>Multiple software components were developed or modified in the course of this project. Please use the navbar to find the respective documentation. The following software components are part of the project:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open MPI: Patrick Huber's adaptive Open MPI fork was extended with a Fortran interface.</li>
  <li>libmpidynres: A Fortran interface was added to libmpidynres.</li>
  <li>LibPFASST: The main component of this project</li>
  <li>tmpi.py: A terminal program for debugging MPI applications with dynamic MPI support.</li>
</ul>
